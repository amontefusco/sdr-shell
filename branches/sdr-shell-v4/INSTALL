Installation Instructions for sdr-shell-v2 RXTX branch.

Distribution Specific Instructions

Fedora 13

(1) Install prerequisite packages with:

  sudo yum install libtool fftw-devel gsl-devel qt-devel liblo-devel hamlib

answer 'yes' to the dependencies.  Sorry, but hamlib really does require
200mb of disk space.

(2) Run 'qmake-qt4' to build the Makefile, then 'make' to build sdr-shell.

(3) Add yourself to the jackusers group in /etc/group.


Ubuntu  * not updated for qt4 *

(1) Install prerequisite packages with:

sudo apt-get install build-essential
sudo apt-get install subversion
sudo apt-get install hamlib-dev
sudo apt-get install qt3-dev-tools
sudo apt-get install libsamplerate0-dev
sudo apt-get install libasound2-dev
sudo apt-get install libfreebob0-dev
sudo apt-get install libffado-dev
sudo apt-get install libsndfile-dev
sudo apt-get install libcelt-dev
sudo apt-get install libreadline-dev
sudo apt-get install autoconf automake
sudo apt-get install manpages-dev
sudo apt-get install fftw3 fftw3-dev libgsl0-dev
sudo apt-get install liblo0ldbl liblo0-dev
sudo apt-get install linux-rt

(2) Run 'qmake' to build the Makefile, then 'make' to build sdr-shell.

(3) Install jack2

svn co http://subversion.jackaudio.org/jack/jack2/trunk/jackmp
cd jackmp
./waf configure --alsa --firewire --freebob
./waf build
sudo ./waf install

The following steps are needed to use jack with the real-time kernel scheduler:

sudo su -c 'echo @audio - rtprio 99 >> /etc/security/limits.conf'
sudo su -c 'echo @audio - memlock 250000 >> /etc/security/limits.conf'
sudo su -c 'echo @audio - nice -10 >> /etc/security/limits.conf'

sudo usermod -G audio -a <user>

Replace <user> by your login_id. The system needs to be rebooted for the
changes to take effect.


All Linux Systems

The following udev rules works well to allow the group softrock to use
usbsoftrock without root privileges. You can put it in /etc/udev/rules.d
and call it softrock.rules.

BUS=="usb", ACTION=="add", SSSYSFS{idVendor}=="16c0", SYSFS{idProduct}=="05dc",
MODE="660", GROUP="softrock"

Fedora 12+ and may be 11, openSUSE 11+, Ubuntu 9.10+ needs below
SUBSYSTEM=3D=3D"usb", ACTION=3D=3D"add", ATTR{idVendor}=3D=3D"16c0",=20
ATTR{idProduct}=3D=3D"05dc", MODE=3D"0660", GROUP=3D"admin", SYMLINK=3D"sof=
trock"

the group "softrock" must exist in /etc/group, or substitute another group
name.


Building for OSX 10.6 * not updated for qt4 *

When setting up to build for OSX, I wanted to use the fink and macports tools
to get the prerequisite packages.  I had very limited success in getting usable
prerequisites.  Both fink and macports build their packages in 32-bit (x86)
mode, while the compiler default on 10.6 is now 64 bit (x86_64) mode.  In order
to build against its packages requires setting:

	PATH=/sw/var/lib/fink/path-prefix-10.6:$PATH

Note that qt3mac from both package systems does not build on OSX 10.6 (it did
build on 10.5) and there doesn't appear to be anyone working on it.  Instead, I
selected 'qt3', which uses x11.

In all, I believe these packages were for building dttsp and sdr-shell:
  fink:
	qt3
  mac ports:
 	fftw-3 @3.2.2_0+i386 (active)
	fftw-3-single @3.2.2_0+i386 (active)
	gsl @1.13_1+darwin_i386 (active)

The more packages were built from source using the instructions in:

  http://groups.yahoo.com/group/dttsp-linux/files/build-dttsp.sh 

I also had to build hamlib-1.2.9 (I recall having to do something ugly to
hamlib to get it to compile -- it probably doesn't work).

Get the JACK Audio Connection Kit from from jackosx.com.  I've never
gotten the JACK in fink or macports to work.
