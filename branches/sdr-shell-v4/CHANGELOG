Version rxtx-5

 - Several fixes to the "zoom out" display, and I now believe it is working
   correctly.

   One thing that can cause the spectrum and spectogram displays to look
   odd is an artifact of how sdr-shell puts together the spectrum buffer.
   The spectrum is centered on the oscillator frequency, which makes
   displaying it simple.  However, if the Osc is set to 12000 hz above
   zero (where tuning using an Si580 with a 48khz sound card) there is
   only 1200hz of valid data above the center frequency.  Above that,
   dttsp repeats the data, backwards.  The result is a display where
   there appears to be a "mirror" on the right side of the window.

   In this version, I draw a green line at where the data ends.

 - Tuning changes.  Scroll wheel tuning now works in the spectrum portion
   of the window, as well as in the spectrogram portion.  Clicking to
   tune in the spectrogram display still does not work well, because
   the two clicks have to be in almost exactly the same spot.  This is
   because of the click-and-drag tuning feature.

 - For packaging, I created an INSTALL and CHANGELOG.  Build instructions have
   moved from README to INSTALL.

Version rxtx-4
Bug Fixes:
 - Change version string to "rxtx.#", where I intend to bump the # on checkins
 - make band switching remember the whole frequeny, not just the rx_delta_f

Organization:
 - moved all the frequency setting code to setRxFrequeny, which now takes an
   argument of whether or not it should set a USBSoftrock
 - remove various bits of dead code

New Features:
 - mouse scroll wheel tunes (shift, ctl and alt increase the tuning steps)
   - includes logitech mice with "3d" scrolling (wheel tilts left/right)

 - hooks for external programs: band switch, mode switch
   Set the environment variables SDR_MODE and SDR_BAND to a program that
   will be run when the mode is changed, either manually or as part of
   recalling a memory.

   I use the mode switch hook to connect a keyer to the TX-dttsp input.
   As an optimization, if the mode does not change, the program is not
   called, nor is a mode change sent to dttsp.  To force a change, use
   shift-click on any of the mode buttons.
   This required adding an argument to the VariModelabel mouseRelease() call.

 - arrow keys can tune 10mhz & 100mhz

 - set the TX dttsp to MUTE on receive.  This reduced the receive noise I was
   getting dramaticly; however, when I hooked up a speaker to the TX Output
   port on my sound card, I found that the microphone input was being passed
   through so it's not really quiet.

 - RIT and SPLIT tuning.  Neither are persistant across band switches or
   program restart.  RIT is reset when tuning with the arrow keys is done
   (tune only by dragging the mouse in the spectrogram display)

   SPLIT is not saved when the program exits (yet).

 - Config menu IQ: for the TX dttsp, added a gain setting for mic input.

 - 5/4 tuning (setting is not persistant across program exits), useful for
   tuning of dual-conversion softrocks, e.g. 144mhz to 28mhz

New Features that Don't Entirely Work:
 - scaling of the display: zoom out 1x, 2x or 4x
   The goal was to permits seeing more or all of the spectrum on the screen
   at once.  I did this by reducing the size of the spectrum buffer from 4096
   to 2048 or 1024 (1/2 and 1/4) and making adjustments in the display code.

   It only partly works.  I think the spectrogram display is wrong (it wraps)
   and it's clear the spectrum display is wrong.

   Use 1, 2, and 4 keys to set zoom (1x, 1/2x, 1/4x).
