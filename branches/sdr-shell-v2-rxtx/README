Getting started using SDR-Shell with the SoftRock RXTX 6.3

Getting a radio working with sdr-shell, dttsp, and utilities is a lot like
building your own radio, but with less solder.  Instead of solder wick and
a solder sucker, you have a reset button.

For information about the SoftRock SDR, see:

	http://www.kb9yig.com		The designer's site
	http://www.wb5rvz.com/sdr	Build instructions
	softrock40@yahoogroups.com	Soft Rock discussion group 
					(Very active)
	dttsp-linux@yahoogroups.com	the dttsp discussion group

sdr-shell requires:
  dttsp (two copies: one recieve one transmit)
  usbsoftrock 1.0.1

Building for Linux

I followed the instructions on w3sz's page:
	http://www.nitehawk.com/w3sz/dttspw3sz.htm

I'm running on Fedora 9.


Building for OSX 10.6

When setting up to build for OSX, I wanted to use the fink and macports tools
to get the prerequisite packages.  I had very limited success in getting usable
prerequisites.  Both fink and macports build their packages in 32-bit (x86)
mode, while the compiler default on 10.6 is now 64 bit (x86_64) mode.  In order
to build against its packages requires setting:

	PATH=/sw/var/lib/fink/path-prefix-10.6:$PATH

Note that qt3mac from both package systems does not build on OSX 10.6 (it did
build on 10.5) and there doesn't appear to be anyone working on it.  Instead, I
selected 'qt3', which uses x11.

In all, I believe these packages were for building dttsp and sdr-shell:
  fink:
	qt3
  mac ports:
 	fftw-3 @3.2.2_0+i386 (active)
	fftw-3-single @3.2.2_0+i386 (active)
	gsl @1.13_1+darwin_i386 (active)

The more packages were built from source using the instructions in:

  http://groups.yahoo.com/group/dttsp-linux/files/build-dttsp.sh 

I also had to build hamlib-1.2.9 (I recall having to do something ugly to
hamlib to get it to compile -- it probably doesn't work).

Get the JACK Audio Connection Kit from from jackosx.com.  I've never
gotten the JACK in fink or macports to work.

Get usbsoftrock from http://groups.yahoo.com/group/softrock40/files/VK6JBL/

Running on Linux

I don't have a unified script to start everything.  I start pieces with:

1)  usbsoftrock -vvv -x 114.230181 -d
the -x <value> comes from a usbsoftrock calibrate

2)  /usr/bin/jackd -R -P55 -p128 -t2000 -dalsa -r48000 -D -Chw:2 -Phw:2 -s
This was using a Delta 44 audio card.

3) RX script
export SDR_DEFRATE=48000
export SDR_NAME=sdr
./sdr-core -s -m&
PIDS="$PIDS $!"
sleep 1
jack_connect sdr:ol alsa_pcm:playback_1 
jack_connect sdr:or alsa_pcm:playback_2
jack_connect alsa_pcm:capture_1 sdr:il        
jack_connect alsa_pcm:capture_2 sdr:ir     
jack_lsp -c
echo $PIDS
echo -n hit return to kill everything:
read
kill $PIDS

4) TX script
PIDS=""
export SDR_DEFRATE=48000
export SDR_NAME=sdr-tx
export SDR_PARMPORT=19005
export SDR_SPECPORT=19006
export SDR_METERPORT=19007
./sdr-core -s -m -v &
PIDS="$PIDS $!"
sleep 1
jack_lsp
jack_connect sdr-tx:ol alsa_pcm:playback_3
jack_connect sdr-tx:or alsa_pcm:playback_4
jack_connect alsa_pcm:capture_1 sdr:il        
jack_connect alsa_pcm:capture_2 sdr:ir     
echo $PIDS
echo -n hit return to kill everything:
read
kill $PIDS

5) sdr-shell
export SDR_DEFRATE=48000
sdr-shell

to send commands to the dttsp command port, use:
  nc -v -u localhost 19001

Running on OSX

I am running on a Macbook Pro (2009 vintage) with a Creative Audigy USB audio
adapter.  It has 5+1 output and a Line/Mic input.  This adapter has given me
some problems: it always requires power cycling following the mac going to
sleep, but has been adequate for occasional use.  With four output channels
and 2 input channels in 24-bit mode, I can only use it for 4800 kHz of spectrum.
With usbsoftrock and the way sdr-shell displays spectrum this been adequate
for me.

1) fix the maximum UDP datagram size:
	sudo sysctl -w net.inet.udp.maxdgram=32768

2)   start the audio midi tool (Applications -> Utilities Audio MIDI Setup)
   create an aggregate device consisting of:
	audio output
	I/Q output
	I/Q input
	audio input (I use the microphone)
   set each to a 48khz input rate.

   deselect the 'thru' selection of the external line connector input source
 

3) start jackd using JackPilot.  I've never gotten jackd to start from
   the commandline due to problems finding shared libraries.

  Configuration:
      Jack Server
	Driver: coreaudio
	Interface: Aggregate Device
	Sample Rate: 4800
	Buffer Size: 2048
	Interface Output Channels: 4
	Interface Input Channels: 4

      Jack Router
	Virtual Input Channels: 4
	Virtual Output Channels: 4
	Auto Connect with physical ports: 4

4) start usbsoftrock
	usbsoftrock -vvv -x 114.230181 -d

	note that the -x <nnn> value came from a usbsoftrock calibrate.

5) Start receive

SDR_DEFRATE=${SDR_DEFRATE-48000}
export SDR_DEFRATE
export SDR_NAME=sdr
#./sdr-core -v -s -m &
./sdr-core -s -m &
PIDS="$PIDS $!"
sleep 1
jack_lsp
jack_connect sdr:ol system:playback_1 
jack_connect sdr:or system:playback_2
jack_connect system:capture_1 sdr:il        
jack_connect system:capture_2 sdr:ir     
jack_lsp -c

echo $PIDS
echo -n hit return to kill everything:
read
kill $PIDS


6) start transmit
PIDS=""
SDR_DEFRATE=${SDR_DEFRATE-48000}
export SDR_DEFRATE
export SDR_PARMPORT=19005
export SDR_SPECPORT=19006
export SDR_METERPORT=19007
export SDR_NAME=sdr-tx
./sdr-core -v -s -m &
PIDS="$PIDS $!"
sleep 1
jack_connect sdr-tx:ol system:playback_3
jack_connect sdr-tx:or system:playback_4
case $1 in
voice )
jack_connect system:capture_3 sdr-tx:il        
jack_connect system:capture_4 sdr-tx:ir
;;
* )
jack_metro -A 1 -b 60 -D 990 &
PIDS="$PIDS $!"
jack_connect metro:60_bpm sdr-tx:il        
jack_connect metro:60_bpm sdr-tx:ir
;;
esac
echo $PIDS
echo -n hit return to kill everything:

kill $PIDS


7) start sdr-shell
export SDR_DEFRATE=48000
sdr-shell



Use Notes

     Clicking the 'rx' symbol switches from receive to transmit and changes the
symbol to tx.  Clicking the 'tx' symbol turns transmit off.

     The receive dttsp is muted during transmit.  I found it unnerving to talk
while hearing myself echoed back with a 1/2 second delay.

     Bands are memories (there are ten of them) that are automaticly saved when
a band change occurs.  Bands wrap from ten to one going up, and from one to ten
when going down.

     I set the dttsp transmit gain to about 15-18 to get maximum power
out of my RXTX.

Miscellaneous


Two Cards
I have, as a test, used two audio cards on Linux with dttsp, by running two
copies of jack:

   default jackd instance:
   /usr/bin/jackd -R -P55 -p128 -t2000 -dalsa -r48000 -D -Chw:2 -Phw:0 -s&
   start the receive dttsp

   second jackd instance:
   export JACK_DEFAULT_SERVER=tx
   /usr/bin/jackd -R -P55 -p128 -t2000 -dalsa -r48000 -D -Chw:0 -Phw:2 -s&
   start the transmit dttsp


I/Q Input on Speakers

If your audio output is on the same audio card as the I/Q input, you'll likely
hear some of the I/Q passed through.

To mute line input:
	amixer -c 0 controls
look for
	numid=18,iface=MIXER,name='Line Playback Switch'

run:
	amixer -c 0 cset numid=18 0

To change the input source:

	amixer controls

look for Capture Source

	amixer -c 0 cset numid=26 0     # set to mic
	amixer -c 0 cset numid=26 4     # set to line

I built the dttsp keyers with:
	gcc -g -O2 -I . -c keyboard-keyer.c
	gcc -g -O2 -I . -c iambic-keyer.c
	gcc  -g -O2   -o keyboard-keyer keyboard-keyer.o  libDttSP.a -llo \
		-lpthread -lm -ljack -lfftw3f
	gcc  -g -O2   -o iambic-keyer iambic-keyer.o  libDttSP.a -llo \
		-lpthread -lm -ljack -lfftw3f
